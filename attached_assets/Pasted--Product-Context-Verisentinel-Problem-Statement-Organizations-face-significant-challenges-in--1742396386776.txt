# Product Context: Verisentinel

## Problem Statement

Organizations face significant challenges in managing compliance requirements across multiple frameworks (PCI DSS, ISO 27001, etc.) while maintaining visibility into their infrastructure. Current solutions are often:

- Fragmented across multiple tools and systems
- Lacking integration between compliance and infrastructure management
- Missing risk-based prioritization for remediation efforts
- Difficult to maintain for audit readiness
- Challenging to visualize network topology in relation to compliance

Small to medium organizations particularly struggle with these challenges due to limited resources and expertise.

## Solution Overview

Verisentinel provides a unified approach to compliance and infrastructure monitoring through:

- **Integrated Compliance Framework**: Combining essential controls from PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and other standards into a single system
- **Risk-Based Severity Mapping**: Assigning severity levels to compliance items for prioritized remediation
- **Hardware Inventory & Topology Visualization**: Maintaining current infrastructure inventory with visual network topology
- **Change Management Workflows**: Enabling controlled processes for critical changes with proper approvals
- **Task Management**: Providing lightweight sprint and task tracking specifically for compliance-related work
- **Security-First Design**: Implementing robust security measures including RBAC, 2FA, and comprehensive audit logging

This monolithic approach creates a single source of truth for managing, storing, transmitting, and computing confidential resources.
