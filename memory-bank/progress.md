# Progress

## What Works
- Basic authentication system
- User registration and login
- Session management
- Role-based access control
- Permission-based UI rendering
- User management interface
- Type-safe permission system
- Client-side permission hooks
- Server-side permission middleware
- Debug information panel
- Manual data refresh functionality

## In Progress
- Role synchronization improvements
- Cache invalidation optimization
- Permission error handling enhancements
- User experience refinements

## Known Issues
1. **Role Synchronization**
   - Client cache may show outdated role information
   - Temporary fix: manual refresh button added
   - Need to implement automatic cache invalidation

2. **Permission System**
   - Edge cases in permission checking need more testing
   - Some UI elements may not update immediately after role changes
   - Need to improve error messages for permission denials

## Next Steps
1. **Short Term**

   - Add automatic cache invalidation
   - Improve permission-related error messages
   - Add more comprehensive permission logging

2. **Medium Term**
   - Implement role change audit logging
   - Add permission group management
   - Create permission documentation
   - Add permission-based routing

3. **Long Term**
   - Dynamic permission management
   - Role hierarchy system
   - Permission inheritance
   - Advanced permission analytics

### Audit Logging
The audit logging system has been implemented with proper severity levels and type safety. The device routes have been updated to use the new system, with proper validation and error handling. The next steps involve updating the remaining routes and implementing the frontend components for viewing and managing audit logs.

### Known Issues
1. Need to update remaining routes with new audit logger
2. Add proper validation across all endpoints
3. Implement frontend components for audit log viewing
4. Add filtering and search capabilities
5. Create export functionality for audit logs

## Next Steps
1. Update remaining routes with audit logger
2. Implement proper validation
3. Create audit log viewer component
4. Add filtering and search
5. Implement export functionality
