# Active Context

## Current State

The project has undergone a major architectural change, transitioning from a Next.js-based monolithic application to a more traditional client-server architecture using Vite and Express.js.

### Recent Changes

1. **Architecture Migration**
   - Moved from Next.js to Vite for frontend build tooling
   - Implemented Express.js backend server
   - Separated client and server code into distinct directories
   - Added WebSocket support for real-time features

2. **Authentication Changes**
   - Switched from NextAuth.js to Passport.js
   - Implemented session-based authentication
   - Added PostgreSQL session store
   - Enhanced security configurations

3. **Frontend Updates**
   - Implemented client-side routing with Wouter
   - Maintained shadcn/ui components
   - Enhanced React Query implementation
   - Added Framer Motion for animations

4. **Backend Structure**
   - Organized routes in a centralized routes.ts
   - Implemented proper middleware chain
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Added WebSocket support

### Active Decisions

1. **Architecture**
   - Client-server separation for better scalability
   - Express.js for backend flexibility
   - Vite for improved development experience
   - WebSocket for real-time capabilities

2. **State Management**
   - React Query for server state
   - Local state with React hooks
   - Form state with React Hook Form
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket

3. **Authentication**
   - Session-based auth with Passport.js
   - PostgreSQL session store
   - Secure cookie configuration
   - Role-based access control
